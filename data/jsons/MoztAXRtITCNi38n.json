Thousands of activists rallied at the court when the case was argued in March . At issue :\n-- Federal benefits . The Defense of Marriage Act , or DOMA , is a 1996 law that says for federal purposes , marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman . That means federal tax , Social Security , pension , and bankruptcy benefits , family medical leave protections -- and a thousand more such provisions -- do not apply to gay and lesbian couples , such as Edie Windsor . The 84-year-old New York woman is the key plaintiff in the DOMA fight . She was forced to pay more than $ 363,000 in extra estate taxes when her longtime spouse , Thea Spyer , died .\n-- State referendums . The California high court had earlier concluded same-sex marriage was legal , but the 2008 voter-approved Proposition 8 abolished it . The high court is being asked to establish same-sex marriage as a constitutional right , but could also decide a more narrow question : whether a state can revoke that right through referendum once it has already been recognized .\nThe political , social , and legal stakes of this long-simmering debate will once again put the high court at the center of national attention , as it was in last summer 's ruling upholding the massive health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama .\nTen states now allow gays and lesbians to legally wed : Connecticut , Iowa , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , New York , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington , as well as the District of Columbia . Delaware and Minnesota 's recently passed laws take effect this summer .\nIt is estimated about 120,000 legally married homosexual couples live in the United States .\nThere is division within the ranks of both sides about whether the court will -- and should -- issue a sweeping ruling on the constitutional `` equal protection '' question . Some activists and politicians -- even some justices themselves -- think the elected branches may be in a better position to drive the same-sex marriage issue , not the courts .\nVoters in three states last November approved same-sex marriage , marking the first time the ballot was used to approve such unions . California is the only state to allow , then revoke same-sex marriage .\n`` This is a conservative court -- conservative ideologically and conservative in the sense that they like to take baby steps , and it seems very unlikely that they would make some big radical move requiring all states to recognize same-sex marriages , '' Goldstein said . `` They are much more likely to do something a little more modest . The other thing about them is that they do n't want to be on the wrong side of history . It seems pretty clear where this is going with a much broader recognition of same-sex marriage , and so the justices do n't want to call that into question when the country is headed in that direction . ''\nIn fact , the court has set itself up to `` punt '' on both Proposition 8 and DOMA , avoiding for now consideration of the constitutional questions .\nThis `` legal letdown '' could turn on `` standing , '' or the legal authority or eligibility to make the case . California 's governor has refused to defend Proposition 8 in court , leaving a coalition of private groups to step in . Can they satisfy court scrutiny by establishing there would be legitimate `` harm '' to themselves if the lower court ruling stands ?\nThe justices could also `` DIG '' it -- or have the case `` dismissed as improvidently granted . '' Basically the justices would be saying they should not have taken the Proposition 8 appeal in the first place .\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor at the March oral argument suggested as much : `` If the issue is letting the states experiment and letting the society have more time to figure out its direction , why is taking a case now the answer ? '' Some of her conservative colleagues seemed to agree as well .\nThe differences between rejecting the case on standing or DIG grounds would be important . A DIG would likely mean lower court rulings striking down Proposition 8 would hold , allowing California gay and lesbian couples to marry if they chose . How quickly that would happen would be unclear if further legal challenges were filed .\nBut a `` standing '' ruling would likely nullify everything , perhaps forcing both sides to start all over again in the lower courts , and limiting the reach of gay marriage to perhaps only a few California counties . Another likely statewide referendum next year could finally settle the matter . Recent polls show growing support for same-sex marriage in California , reflecting a trend nationwide .\nDOMA has its own sticky procedural questions . Obama now supports gay marriage , and has refused to defend the 1996 federal law . That has left House Republicans as the official parties in support of DOMA .\nSo the court could also dismiss that case on standing grounds , but most legal analysts see a more substantive ruling on DOMA 's merits .\nPicking winners and losers at this stage is a subjective , even partisan , exercise . The court itself will be both cheered and vilified however it rules . But as an institution , it has survived similar crises of confidence over its discretionary authority in rulings involving slavery , racial integration , corporate power , abortion -- even Bush v. Gore .\nRapid-fire reaction to these big cases will be swift and furious from the professional punditry and halls of government . Some individual Americans stand to gain from the decisions , others could be hurt financially , emotionally , and physically .\nSo why entrust all this in the hands of nine judges ?\nThe Supreme Court usually gets the last word in these matters , regardless of whether one agrees with the decisions . That is true even in matters of life and death , which many argue are the stakes in this health care debate .\nJustice Robert Jackson , on the court from 1941 to 1954 , may have put it best : `` We are not final because we are infallible , but we are infallible only because we are final .

After Chief Justice William Rehnquist died, Bush named Roberts to the chief justice post. The court has moved to the right during Roberts' tenure, although Roberts supplied the key vote to uphold Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: Today's Supreme Court Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court by President Ronald Reagan in 1988. He is a conservative justice but has provided crucial swing votes in many cases. He has authored landmark opinions that include Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: Today's Supreme Court Clarence Thomas is the second African-American to serve on the court, succeeding Thurgood Marshall when he was appointed by President George H. W. Bush in 1991. Thomas is a conservative and a strict constructionist who supports states' rights. Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: Today's Supreme Court Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court.

Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: Today's Supreme Court Stephen Breyer was appointed by Clinton in 1994 and is part of the court's liberal wing. Hide Caption 6 of 10 Photos: Today's Supreme Court Samuel Alito was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2006 and is known as one of the most conservative justices to serve on the court in modern times. Hide Caption 7 of 10 Photos: Today's Supreme Court Sonia Sotomayor is the court's first Hispanic and third female justice. She was appointed by Obama in 2009 and is regarded as a resolutely liberal member of the court. Hide Caption 8 of 10 Photos: Today's Supreme Court Elena Kagan is the fourth female justice to ever be appointed, and she is counted among the court's liberal wing. She was appointed by Obama in 2010 at the age of 50. She is the court's youngest member. Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: Today's Supreme Court Neil Gorsuch is the court's newest member. He was chosen by President Donald Trump to replace Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016.
