The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity :\nCNN : The suburbanites around Denver are exactly the kind of independent-minded voters President Barack Obama needs in his fold to win in November . Do you see the campaign 's questions about Mitt Romney 's record at Bain Capital and offshore bank accounts resonating with those voters or do they fall flat ?\nGov . John Hickenlooper : To a certain extent , the suburban soccer moms are somewhat accepting of the fact that business is rough and tumble , and that some jobs get cut when you are taking over a business that 's failing . Some job cuts are necessary .\nBut I think they have a different sensitivity if people are avoiding paying taxes in the United States and making profits on business done in the United States but finding ways to avoid taxation . I think as more facts come out , that 's something that of all the Bain-related stories might have some serious ramifications in terms of how normal people deal with it .\nWhat 's interesting , especially with the independent voters , is there is a level of patriotism . We pay our taxes , and we do n't want to pay any more taxes , we hate government waste . But everyone should pay their share . It 's almost visceral .\nWhen I was in the restaurant business , I used to see people get into these debates . It 's liberal Democrats , it 's conservative Republicans , it 's almost all independents . There is a tremendous repulsion for people that get out of paying their share .\nCNN : As a business guy , do you think some of the harder-edged questions about Romney 's private sector record turn off some people in the business community ?\nHickenlooper : It does . There are certain people that think that . I think what people are concerned about is you 're branding all business as bad , which is certainly not the case . No step forward this country has ever taken has been without the business community helping move us forward . Whether you care about homelessness , whether you care about education reform or whatever , the resources for that come from economic vitality -- a whole lot of businesses being successful and creating wealth , and then that wealth being used to help homeless kids .\nCNN : Do you view his experience at Bain as part of wealth creation at large , the kind that lifts up homeless kids , for instance , or is it a different thing entirely ?\nI think what really creates wealth in this country , the major part of our wealth creation , comes from entrepreneurs , people starting businesses . That 's my preference because I lived part of that life . If you really squint your eyes and look at job creation , entrepreneurs create businesses , create jobs . They are always creating something .\nGenerally it 's small businesses , but when they get acquired by a large business as part of that acquisition , there are overlapping marketing departments , overlapping accounting departments , so they shed jobs . There is a downsizing . So once that happens , once you get these companies consolidating , they are always looking at efficiency . And that is really not job creation .\nThere are exceptions . As you get larger companies together , they shed jobs and they become more efficient and more profitable , so the stock price goes up , but that 's not pushing the country forward at the same level that entrepreneurs are . They are the ones that are creating the jobs that have customers . That is one of the defining points . They are creating jobs that have customers rather than just trying to control costs .\nCNN : When your friends in the business community complain about the president or say that Romney will lower their taxes or costs , what do you say to convince them that Obama is going to help their bottom line ?\nHickenlooper : We have many discussions . What I tell everyone is what we need to create in this country is rising tide . We have to get the whole country moving forward . That 's not just one thing or one component of our economy . That 's the whole economy , right ?\nSo you ca n't keep cutting funding for higher education . That 's a big part of how these entrepreneurs get started -- research grants or great ideas that come out of some laboratory at Colorado State University .
