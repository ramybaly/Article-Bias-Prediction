The firm is under investigation .\nDisassembled shotgun : The bag Alexis was carrying apparently contained a disassembled Remington 870 shotgun , a law enforcement official said . Alexis is seen on surveillance video ducking into a bathroom and leaving with the shotgun .\n30 minutes : Authorities believe Alexis came out of the bathroom and immediately began shooting at random , FBI Director James Comey said Thursday . Investigators believe he then went floor to floor shooting at workers , Comey said . Authorities and witnesses had previously said it appeared Alexis shot mostly from the building 's atrium .

They 've pored over his computers and other possessions . But , say law enforcement sources , nothing points to a specific motive for the rampage . `` I 'll reserve judgment on that until all of the work of the FBI is done , '' Lanier told CNN 's Blitzer . `` There 's still a lot more to do .

Police notified the Navy . The Navy is n't commenting .\nStrange behavior : Also in August , Alexis apparently had an altercation with a family at an airport in Virginia . He thought a woman was laughing at him and became angry . `` He started getting a little belligerent , and started using profanity , and going off , '' said Glynda Boyd . Her brother approached someone to call security , which calmed him down . But Alexis left an unsettling impression . `` It was weird . That never happened to us before like that .
