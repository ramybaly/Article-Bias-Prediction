    "content": "The Obama administration found itself defending -- and beginning to explain -- yet another surveillance effort after leaked documents revealed information about two secret National Security Agency intelligence-gathering programs .\nOn top of a Guardian newspaper report that revealed how authorities were collecting phone records from millions , a Washington Post report detailed another program that scours major Internet companies including Google and Facebook for data . A former senior NSA official confirmed to Fox News that the program was started in 2007 by the FBI and NSA and allows them to tap into top U.S. Internet companies to pull audio , video and other data .\nWhile civil liberties groups cried foul over the program , Director of National Intelligence James Clapper issued a statement late Thursday decrying the leak of the materials . He called the disclosure of the program that allows the NSA to collect communications data from Internet companies `` reprehensible '' and said the phone-records monitoring leak could cause harm to the nation 's intelligence gathering activities .\nAt the same time , he took the rare step of moving to declassify information about the programs as he sought to defend them against criticism .\n\u201c The article omits key information regarding how a classified intelligence collection program is used to prevent terrorist attacks and the numerous safeguards that protect privacy and civil liberties , '' he said of the Guardian story .\nClapper also said the government was `` prohibited from indiscriminately sifting through the telephony metadata acquired under the program. \u201d All information acquired , he said , \u201c is subject to strict , court-imposed restrictions on review and handling . The court only allows the data to be queried when there is a reasonable suspicion , based on specific facts , that the particular basis for the query is associated with a foreign terrorist organization . \u201c\nSeveral hours earlier , a senior administration official also pushed back , saying the Guardian article and Washington Post article about the Internet mining refers to collection under a law that `` does not allow the targeting of any U.S. citizen or of any person located within the United States . \u201d\nIt was not immediately clear how the official defined \u201c targeting . \u201d\n\u201c The program is subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , the Executive Branch , and Congress , \u201d the official said . \u201c It involves extensive procedures , specifically approved by the court , to ensure that only non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. are targeted , and that minimize the acquisition , retention and dissemination of incidentally acquired information about U.S. persons . \u201d\nA former NSA official told Fox News the FBI and National Security Agency ( NSA ) have been tapping into leading U.S. Internet companies to pull audio , video and photographs .\nAccording to the official , the program began in 2007 and is in the second phase .
