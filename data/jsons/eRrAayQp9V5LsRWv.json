He fired multiple magazines -- each one with 30 bullets -- from a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle to kill six adults and 20 children from two classrooms . Each victim was shot multiple times before Lanza used a handgun to kill himself .\nWhy ? Authorities have n't given a motive . But they are looking into shards of the remnants of the shooter 's smashed home computer -- -- including e-mails he may have sent and websites he may have visited -- hoping it will shed light on his thinking , a law enforcement official said Monday .\nAuthorities are also probing Lanza 's history with firearms . The three weapons found near his dead body were the semiautomatic .223-caliber rifle made by Bushmaster and two handguns made by Glock and Sig Sauer . A shotgun was found in his car nearby , according to Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance .\nThe weapons belonged to his mother , Nancy Lanza , who was found shot dead in her Newtown home Friday . She collected firearms , shot them and went to gun ranges , Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives spokeswoman Debora Seifert said Monday .\nThe mother and the son who killed her even went to a range together . From what the ATF has been able to determine thus far , `` their most recent visit was more than six months ago , '' Seifert said .\nBeyond such developments , officials overall were tight-lipped Monday about their investigation . Hundreds of state troopers , detectives and other law enforcement personnel are analyzing every round of ammunition fired , examining the gunman 's medical history and talking to witnesses , said Vance , the state police spokesman .\nInvestigators plan to interview a pair of adults wounded `` in their lower extremities . '' The hope is the two -- whom authorities have not identified , though a parent last week said one was a vice principal at the school -- could , `` when it 's medically appropriate , '' play a key role in helping to reconstruct what happened , said Vance .\n`` I 'm not at liberty to discuss any of the information so far uncovered , but suffice it to say ... we will cover every single facet , '' the police spokesman said of the investigation .\nThe anguish caused by the shooting was visible Monday outside a Newtown funeral home , as young and old streamed in to pay their respects to 6-year-old Jack Pinto .\nOne of the sports fanatic 's idols , New York Giants receiver Victor Cruz , paid tribute during his game Sunday by writing `` Jack Pinto My Hero '' on his cleats . Afterward , the NFL player said he is `` amazed '' Jack 's family chose to bury the boy wearing a child-size Cruz jersey .\n`` I do n't even know how to put it into words , '' Cruz said .\nThe 6-year-old himself was a budding athlete . Shortly before his death , he wrestled in his first match and earned a medal , said New Milford Youth Wrestling Association President Ken Linder .\nMany of his teammates wore medals into Jack 's funeral Monday . Others , many of them about his age , came in Newtown youth sports shirts . The funeral home could n't contain the mourners , with the line extending to the street .\nJack was n't the only one remembered Monday . So , too , was Noah Pozner , another 6-year-old whose family said he could get what he wanted just by batting his long eyelashes .\nNoah loved playing with his siblings , especially his twin sister . They still do n't know how their brother died , Noah 's aunt said .\n`` How do you tell them that 's how their brother died ? '' Victoria Haller said Sunday . `` It 's the unthinkable , really . ''\nMore funerals are coming . For instance , there 's Jessica Rekos on Tuesday . Benjamin Wheeler on Thursday . Madeleine Hsu on Friday . All of them are 6 years old .\nAnd once everyone is buried , residents say it 's unlikely their tight-knit community will ever be the same .\n`` It 's incomprehensible , the pain here , '' Darla Henggeler said . `` You ca n't imagine . We 're still in shock . I ca n't let my heart go there because it 's so overwhelming .\n`` Once it settles in , I think my heart will break .
