''\nOn Wednesday , Vester Lee Flanagan II produced a real-time murder show that he choreographed in detail .\nIn a ranting note sent to ABC News before his death , Flanagan blamed his misery on black men and white women and said he was `` somewhat racist against whites , blacks and Latinos .

He decided to buy a gun days after the Charleston , South Carolina , church shooting in June , he said .\nFlanagan shot dead Parker and Ward while she was live on air on WDBJ via Ward 's camera , a video of the incident showed .\nFlanagan , a former TV reporter himself who went by the pseudonym Bryce Williams , wounded Vicki Gardner , head of a local chamber of commerce , whom Parker was interviewing .\nJUST WATCHED Boyfriend : I 'm trying to find the strength Replay More Videos ...
