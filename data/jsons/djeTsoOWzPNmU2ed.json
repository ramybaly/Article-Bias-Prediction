    "content": "( CNN ) Investigators are learning more about the speeding Amtrak train that derailed in Philadelphia , killing eight and sending over 200 to the hospital , but the jury is still out on the big questions .\nWhy did the train accelerate as it approached a curve ? Did the engineer cause the train to speed up , or was there a mechanical failure ? Was there something about the track that caused the crash ?\n`` What I believe is a very good way to interview people is , honestly , to not ask them questions , to basically give them a figurative blank sheet of paper and ask them what they recall , '' Sumwalt said Thursday . `` Really , we want to know his account of what he recalls leading into this tragic accident . ''\nInvestigators are looking at a `` good quality video '' that shows the train speeding up in the moments leading up to its derailment . They do n't know yet what caused the train to accelerate to more than 100 mph . Sumwalt said 65 seconds before the end of the recording , the train speed went above 70 mph , and then steadily increased .\n`` It just shows the speed alone , '' Sumwalt said . `` It does n't tell how the speed got there . ''\nBostian 's lawyer told ABC 's `` Good Morning America '' his client `` has absolutely no recollection whatsoever '' after losing consciousness in Tuesday night 's crash .\n`` He remembers coming into the curve ( and ) attempting to reduce speed , '' attorney Robert Goggin said . `` ... The last thing he recalls is coming to , looking for his bag , getting his cell phone , turning it on and calling 911 . ''\nInitial data show the train barreled into a curve at about 106 mph , Sumwalt said . That 's more than twice the 50-mph speed limit for the curve , and above the 80-mph limit immediately before it .\nThe engineer of the Amtrak train was identified as Brandon Bostian , 32 , of New York .\nThe engineer ca n't recall engaging the emergency brake , even though Sumwalt has said he did so `` just moments '' before the train derailed . Goggin thinks his client 's memories may return as he recovers from a concussion . Bostian has 15 staples in his head , stitches in one leg and his other leg immobilized , according to his lawyer .\nGoggin insisted his client had n't been talking or texting on his phone before he made the 911 call . Nor did he have other notable accidents or mishaps . And his lawyer said Bostian voluntarily took a blood test and there was `` no drinking , no drugs , no medical conditions . Nothing . ''\nMayor Michael Nutter said the engineer did `` a pretty short interview ( then ) indicated that he did n't want '' to talk more . The mayor noted Bostian survived after his engine car `` tumbled over and over '' and that he does n't have to offer more information right away .\n`` He does n't have to be interviewed if he does n't want to at this particular stage , '' Nutter said . `` That 's kind of how the system works . ''\nGoggin says his client , who will talk with investigators `` when they ask , '' already told them `` everything he knew . He cooperated fully . ''\nThe train , which was on time on its trip Washington to New York , was carrying 238 passengers and five crew members when it derailed at about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday . Survivors recalled an otherwise sleepy , mundane ride devolving into chaos as cars tilted and toppled , sending most everything -- from luggage to laptops , from phones to people -- flying .\nEight people died . They include Associated Press video software architect Jim Gaines , U.S . Naval Academy Midshipman Justin Zemser and Derrick Griffith , a dean of student affairs for City University of New York Medgar Evers College .\nThe latest fatality is a person pulled from the wreckage of the first car Thursday morning . City Fire Commissioner Derrick Sawyer said a call came in around 8 a.m. `` to bring back our cadaver dog , '' and after that `` we were able to find another passenger in the wreckage . '' That body was taken to the medical examiner 's office .\nWith that discovery , Nutter said all 243 people thought to have been on the train are accounted for . At least six people remain in critical condition . But most of the more than 200 people injured have been or will soon be released from hospitals .\n`` I want to express my gratitude for the first responders , who raced to save lives , and for the many passengers who , despite their own injuries , made heroic efforts to get fellow passengers to safety , '' President Barack Obama said Thursday , offering prayers for the victims .\nBostian , the engineer , is among those recovering . As he does , Philadelphia 's mayor singled him out .\nIn a CNN interview Wednesday , Nutter called the engineer 's driving `` reckless , '' adding , `` There 's no way in the world he should have been going that fast into the curve . ''\n`` I do n't know what was going on with him . I do n't know what was going on in the cab , but there 's really no excuse that can be offered , literally , unless he had a heart attack . ''\nJUST WATCHED Mayor : 'Clearly he was reckless and irresponsible ' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mayor : 'Clearly he was reckless and irresponsible ' 07:18\nSumwalt , the NTSB board member , immediately blasted the mayor 's comments as inflammatory .\n`` You 're not going to hear the NTSB making comments like that , '' he said . `` We want to get the facts before we start making judgments . ''\nNutter referenced his CNN comments during a Thursday afternoon press conference , insisting he has the utmost respect for Sumwalt and the NTSB . He said he 'd spoken `` from the heart '' in the `` heat of the moment , '' expressing an opinion as the mayor and as a citizen .\n`` In no way , shape or form should my comments be taken as to be judgmental about their process or what might happen or anything else . I often speak from the heart , '' Nutter said , adding he was not interested in a public back-and-forth with the NTSB . `` It is literally meaningless in the whole scheme of things . ''\nFor all the high emotions in Philadelphia , things were decidedly calmer at that city 's main train station and those in Washington and New York -- because many trains simply were n't running .\nNew York 's Penn Station was relatively sedate for a weekday , as evident by rows of empty seats and Amtrak ticket counters . Local trains ran as normal , and other workarounds were in place -- such as New Jersey Transit honoring Amtrak tickets between New York City and Trenton , New Jersey .\nFor many travelers , it was an inconvenience .

He expects they 'll be able to do so again next week , starting with limited service between Philadelphia and New York on Monday .\n`` We 're really looking at full service by Tuesday , '' Boardman said .\nJUST WATCHED How to survive a train wreck Replay More Videos ...
