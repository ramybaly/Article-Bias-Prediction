King may be a national hero whose birthday the country commemorates on Monday , but to many he remains a one-dimensional hero -- the vast body of his work unknown . Though he wrote five books and delivered up to 450 speeches a year , he 's defined by one speech and one letter .\nWhat then are the great works by King that never get the attention they deserve ?\nThat 's the question CNN put to some members of King 's inner circle as well as top King scholars . We asked them to pick their favorite overlooked gems from King , any extraordinary spoken or written words people do n't typically hear during King commemorations .\nSix entries made our final cut : three sermons and speeches , King 's most radical book , an astonishing letter he wrote as a college student , and a `` eulogy '' he delivered for a friend that revealed a side of him the public rarely saw .\nSermon delivered at Riverside Church in New York on April 4 , 1967 .\nWhy it 's important : This was King 's most : This was King 's most controversial speech . Even some members of his own staff warned him not to give it . With this sermon , King decisively came out against the Vietnam War at a time when many Americans still supported it . People were furious . President Lyndon Johnson stopped talking to him . Civil rights leaders criticized him , and major newspapers told him to stick to civil rights . Yet King put principle over personal popularity and continued to oppose the war . One year later to the day he gave this speech , King was assassinated in Memphis , Tennessee .\nWhat he said : Money that should have been spent on Johnson 's War on Poverty was being lost in Vietnam 's killing fields . He said , `` A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death . '' The speech distilled King 's belief that racism , economic exploitation and war were all connected as `` triple evils . ''\nSignature lines : `` We are taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them 8,000 miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which they had not found in Southwest Georgia and East Harlem . So we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools . ''\nWhat others say : `` It 's Dr. King 's most underappreciated speech , '' says Vorris Nunley , a professor of rhetoric at the University of California , Riverside . `` Former supporters , black as well as white , backed away from this too compassionate , too radical , too political King . ''\nSpeech delivered on March 25 , 1965 , in Montgomery , Alabama , at the end of the Selma-to-Montgomery march .\nWhy it 's important : It is one of King 's most : It is one of King 's most electrifying speeches . When the roaring crowd joins King in shouting `` Glory hallelujah ! '' at the end of the speech , the march becomes a church revival . The speech was the culmination of one of the movement 's most brutal but critical campaigns . Three civil rights activists were killed and other marchers were beaten at the Edmund Pettus Bridge . King gave his defiant speech while standing on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery , a city known as the `` Cradle of the Confederacy . '' This was the high-water mark of the civil rights movement . The Selma campaign would spark the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act .\nWhat he said : King praised the white clergy and laypeople of various faiths who traveled to Selma to face danger with African-American protesters . He said that segregation was `` on its deathbed '' and the movement must now be prepared to `` march on poverty . ''\nSignature lines : `` They told us we would n't get here . And there were those who said that we would get here only over their dead bodies , but all the world today knows that we are here and that we are standing before the forces of power in the state of Alabama saying , 'We ai n't going to let nobody turn us around . '\n`` I come to say to you this afternoon , however difficult the moment , however frustrating the hour , it will not be long , because 'truth crushed to earth will rise again . ' How long ? Not long , because 'no lie can live forever . ' ... How long ? Not long , because the arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends toward justice . ''\nWhat others say : The speech marked the triumphant end of the first phase of the civil rights movement -- seeking legal and political rights -- and the beginning of a new phase focused on economic inequality , says Jerald Podair , a history professor at Lawrence University in Appleton , Wisconsin .\n`` We see King at a moment of triumph , '' Podair says . `` He is on the steps of the Alabama State Capitol , near the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church from which he launched the Montgomery bus boycott , as ( Alabama ) Gov . George Wallace cowers in his office with blinds drawn . But he also has miles to go . America is still an economically and socially divided nation .\nSermon delivered at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta on July 4 , 1965 .\nWhy it 's important : We 've heard about King 's dream . But just two years later he told an audience that his dream had turned into a nightmare . King 's We 've heard about King 's dream . But just two years later he told an audience that his dream had turned into a nightmare . King 's sermon addresses questions that could have been snatched from today 's headlines : What is a living wage for workers in menial jobs ? Is income inequality as corrosive as racial injustice ? What are the challenges of preserving a multicultural democracy ?\nWhat he said : King said that class divisions within the United States `` can be as vicious and evil as a system based on racial injustice . '' King also talked about the dignity of all work , saying that even menial workers should make enough `` so they can live and educate their children and buy a home and have the basic necessities of life . ''\nSignature lines : `` About two years ago now , I stood with many of you who stood there in person and all of you who were there in spirit before the Lincoln Memorial in Washington . As I came to the end of my speech there , I tried to tell the nation about a dream I had . I must confess to you this morning that since that sweltering August afternoon in 1963 , my dream has often turned into a nightmare .\nI must confess to you this morning that ... my dream has often turned into a nightmare The Rev . Martin Luther King Jr .\n`` I 've seen my dream shattered as I 've walked the streets of Chicago and see Negroes , young men and women , with a sense of utter hopelessness because they ca n't find any jobs . ... I 've seen my dream shattered as I 've been through Appalachia , and I 've seen my white brothers along with Negroes living in poverty . And I 'm concerned about white poverty as much as I 'm concerned about Negro poverty . ''\n`` King asks : How are you going to have a multiracial democracy if inequality makes life is so harsh and competitive at the bottom , where society is most multiracial and multinational ? ''\nWhy it 's important : `` Every hero becomes a bore at last . '' That quote from the 19th century writer Ralph Waldo Emerson could have applied to King . With the rise of the Black Power movement , King seemed dull and obsolete to many youths in the late 1960s who preferred the fire of Malcolm X and the Black Panthers . King dressed like an undertaker and carefully measured each word in public . But King 's `` mock eulogy '' reveals that in private King had a wicked sense of humor . He was a man who nicknamed one of his top aides , `` Lil ' Nigger , '' drank Harveys Bristol Cream sherry and smoked in private , and liked `` playing the dozens , '' an African-American tradition of friends good-naturedly trading insults .\nWhat he said : The moment is grim . King is holding a meeting of top staffers in 1963 just before they initiate a campaign in Birmingham . He warns them that some may not return alive . Then he breaks the tension by assuring them he would preach a marvelous tribute for anyone who does n't make it . He proceeds by delivering an The moment is grim .

He proceeds by delivering an over-the-top eulogy for one of his aides at the meeting , Andrew Young , who was often dispatched to negotiate with white leaders because of his nonthreatening demeanor .\nSignature lines : `` Andy , when the Klan finally gets you , here 's what I 'll preach : 'Lord , white folks made a big mistake today .
