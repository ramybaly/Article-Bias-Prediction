Agents must protect Trump \u2013 who has traveled almost every weekend to his properties in Florida , New Jersey and Virginia \u2013 and his adult children whose business trips and vacations have taken them across the country and overseas .\n`` The president has a large family , and our responsibility is required in law , '' Alles said . `` I ca n't change that . I have no flexibility . ''\nAlles said the service is grappling with an unprecedented number of White House protectees . Under Trump , 42 people have protection , a number that includes 18 members of his family . That 's up from 31 during the Obama administration .\nOverwork and constant travel have also been driving a recent exodus from the Secret Service ranks , yet without congressional intervention to provide additional funding , Alles will not even be able to pay agents for the work they have already done .\nThe compensation crunch is so serious that the director has begun discussions with key lawmakers to raise the combined salary and overtime cap for agents , from $ 160,000 per year to $ 187,000 for at least the duration of Trump 's first term .\nBut even if such a proposal was approved , about 130 veteran agents would not be fully compensated for hundreds of hours already amassed , according to the agency .\n`` I do n't see this changing in the near term , '' Alles said .\nBoth Republican and Democratic lawmakers expressed deep concern for the continuing stress on the agency , first thrust into turmoil five years ago with disclosures about sexual misconduct by agents in Colombia and subsequent White House security breaches .\nA special investigative panel formed after a particularly egregious 2014 White House breach also found that that agents and uniform officers worked `` an unsustainable number of hours , '' which also contributed to troubling attrition rates .\nWhile about 800 agents and uniformed officers were hired during the past year as part of an ongoing recruiting blitz to bolster the ranks , attrition limited the agency 's net staffing gain to 300 , according to agency records . And last year , Congress had to approve a one-time fix to ensure that 1,400 agents would be compensated for thousands of hours of overtime earned above compensation limits . Last year 's compensation shortfall was first disclosed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n`` It is clear that the Secret Service 's demands will continue to be higher than ever throughout the Trump administration , '' said Jennifer Werner , a spokesperson for Maryland Rep.
