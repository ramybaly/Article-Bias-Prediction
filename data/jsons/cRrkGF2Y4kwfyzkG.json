He was the first Republican presidential candidate to win all of the state \u2019 s 55 counties .\nBut Mr. Romney also has also campaigned in crucial presidential primary states such as Iowa and New Hampshire .\nThis week , Mr. Romney is barnstorming across the country to lend a hand in Senate and House races .\nHe started with a rally in Florida with Carlos Curbelo , who is running in the Republican primary to challenge Democratic Rep. Joe Garcia .\nIn this south-central West Virginia town , he appeared with Republican Shelley Moore Capito , who leads in the polls against Democrat Natalie Tennant in the contest for an open U.S. Senate seat ; Republican Evan Jenkins , who is in a tight race to unseat incumbent Democrat Rep.

So , I don \u2019 t have to worry too much about it , \u201d Mr. Romney said when a local TV reporter asked about his comment from 2003 .\nMr. Romney was pressed about how the comment reflected on Mrs. Capito in West Virginia coal country .\n\u201c Fortunately , she has her own positions and she doesn \u2019 t have to accept all of mine , \u201d he said . \u201c But the other thing is , I did run for president twice and I think I made it very clear in my presidential campaigns that I \u2019 m a friend of coal . \u201d\n\u201c Gov .
