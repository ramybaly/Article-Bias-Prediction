With the city under siege for three weeks , the black-clad fighters have begun to raise their flag over neighborhoods and UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura said the city was about to fall .\n`` The world has seen with its own eyes the images of what happens when a city in Syria or in Iraq is overtaken by the terrorist group called ISIS or Da'esh : massacres , humanitarian tragedies , rapes , horrific violence , '' De Mistura said . `` The international community can not sustain another city falling under ISIS .\n`` The world , all of us , will regret deeply if ISIS is able to take over a city which has defended itself with courage but is close to not being able to do so , '' De Mistura added . `` We need to act now . ''\nWith the fighting taking place with view of the Turkish border , international pressure increased on Ankara to get involved militarily . Turkey has already taken in an estimated 200,000 refugees , and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the coalition air campaign launched last month would not be enough to halt the Islamic State group 's advance .\n`` Kobani is about to fall , '' Erdogan told Syrian refugees in the Turkish border town of Gaziantep , according to The Associated Press .\nErdogan , whose troops are massed near the border but have so far not taken an offensive posture , called for greater cooperation with the Syrian opposition , which is fighting both the extremists and forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad .\n`` We asked for three things : one , for a no-fly zone to be created ; two , for a secure zone parallel to the region to be declared ; and for the moderate opposition in Syria and Iraq to be trained and equipped . ''\nThe capture of Kobani would give ISIS control of a large swath of land bordering Turkey and eliminate a vital pocket of Kurdish resistance . It would also provide a link between the group 's territory near the ancient Syrian city of Aleppo and its largest operations base at Raqqa in northeastern Syria .\nThe Associated Press reported that warplanes believed to be part of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State , struck militant positions Tuesday . Journalists on the Turkish side of the border heard the sound of warplanes before two large plumes of smoke billowed just west of Kobani . A Fox News crew on the Turkish side of the border reported only one U.S. airstrike in the previous five days .\nFighting continued into Tuesday morning on the outskirts of the town . One coordinator with the Kurdish defenders told The New York Times that their defenses benefited from the new round of airstrikes , but they were still outmatched by the more heavily armed militants .\nOn Tuesday morning , the AP reported that occasional gunfire could be heard in Kobani , also known by the Arabic name Ayn Arab . A flag of the Kurdish force known as the People 's Protection Units , or YPG , was seen flying over a hill in the center of town .\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that ISIS fighters had entered the eastern outskirts of the city on Monday after capturing more than 300 surrounding Syrian Kurdish villages in the previous three weeks . The paper also reported that the militants raised their black flag in two separate places , one on top of a civilian apartment building and another on a hilltop near a checkpoint at the city \u2019 s eastern entrance . The flag at the checkpoint could be seen by reporters watching from across the border in Turkey .\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Kurds forced the jihadists to withdraw from the eastern part of the town in heavy clashes after midnight Tuesday , adding that five loud explosions were heard in the town as warplanes soared overhead .
