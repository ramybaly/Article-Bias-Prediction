But the crew apparently boosted the power to the engines , which were increasing from 50 % capacity three seconds before impact , according to Hersman .\nOne-and-a-half seconds before impact , the crew called for a `` go-around , '' meaning that they wanted to abort the landing and go around in the air to try to make another landing , she said .\nBut they did n't make it . `` There just was n't enough room to recover , '' Rosenberg said .\nInvestigators have found a path of wreckage that started at the seawall and continued to the main wreckage site hundreds of feet up the runway , Hersman added .\nThe pavement itself was scarred from contact with the landing gear , the engines and the fuselage , Hersman said .\nThe tail 's lower portion was in the rocks at the seawall and `` a significant piece of the tail '' was in the water , she said . Additional aircraft parts were visible at low tide . On the path that leads along the pavement away from the seawall were horizontal stabilizers , a vertical stabilizer and an upper portion of the tail cone , she said .\nThe air-traffic control team found no evidence on voice communications of any distress calls before the accident , she said .\nBut investigators have found that the pilots had the appropriate charts for the airport and approach in place in the cockpit , she added . The NTSB was working to find out what the four pilots had done during the 72 hours before the crash in an attempt to determine whether fatigue or sickness may have played a role , she said .\nA preliminary review of FAA radar data indicates that there was `` no abnormally steep descent curve that 's been detected '' in the landing approach of the jet , she said , reacting to media reports citing a steeper descent .\nAnd a preliminary review of the engines indicates that both engines were producing power when the plane crashed , she said .\nInvestigators were focusing on the crew and aircraft as they try to learn why the giant jet clipped the end of runway before crashing , she had said earlier in the day .\n`` We 're certainly looking at the crew and how they operated , how they were trained , at their experience , '' Hersman told CNN 's New Day .\n`` We 're also looking at the aircraft .

He has about 10,000 hours as a pilot , Asiana said .\nHersman , who has discouraged speculation about whether the crew bore responsibility for the crash , downplayed the significance of the pilot 's experience in her New Day interview .\n`` It 's not unusual for crew to change aircraft types , '' she said . And with air crews flying all around the world , it 's not unusual for pilots to fly into unfamiliar airports for the first time either .\nShe said it 's important for the two pilots in charge of the aircraft during the `` very risky '' landing phase to work closely together , and while she said investigators have no evidence of cockpit communications problems , it 's something investigators will be looking at .\nMary Schiavo , a former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation , said video and other data related to the crash suggest the crew `` lost situational awareness '' while approaching the airport .\n`` They 're low and slow , and that 's a problem , '' Schiavo said .\nAll four pilots have been interviewed by NTSB and South Korean investigators , said Choi Jeong-ho , the head of South Korea 's Aviation Policy Bureau .\n`` We can not reveal what 's been said as it is an ongoing investigation , '' Choi said .\nThe pilots represented two teams -- a crew and a relief crew , said Hersman .\n`` I think it really is too early to conclude pilot error , because there is so much that we do n't know , '' she told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer .\nThe cockpit voice recorder -- which has been flown to Washington for analysis -- contains conversations between the pilots that were carried out in a combination of English and Korean , she said .\nHersman said that in most airplane crashes , investigators rarely find a single explanation for what went wrong .\n`` In most of our investigations , we find that it 's not just one thing , it really is a combination of factors that lead to an accident , '' she said .\nWhile weather has been ruled out as a factor , other factors officials are investigating include whether construction at the airport may have played a role , Hersman said Sunday .\nWork to extend a runway safety area required the temporary shutdown of a system designed to help pilots land planes safely , she said .\nThe pilots apparently tried to speed up seven seconds before the crash , cockpit voice and flight data recorders showed .\nA stall warning sounded three seconds later , telling the pilots the plane was about to lose its ability to stay in the air .\nThen -- just 1.5 seconds before the plane slammed into the runway -- the crew decided to call off the landing and try to pull up for another try , Hersman said .\nWith no warning from the cockpit , survivors said , the plane 's rear struck the sea wall at the end of the runway . The impact severed the plane 's tail and sent the rest of the body spinning on its belly .\nIn addition to the two deaths , 182 people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from severe scrapes to paralysis .\n`` We 're lucky there has n't been a greater loss of life , '' San Francisco Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White said .\nSome injured passengers remained hospitalized Monday , including six in critical condition at San Francisco General Hospital , said Dr. Margaret Knudson , the hospital 's chief of surgery .\nAbout half of those admitted to the hospital had spinal fractures , she said . Others have head trauma .\n`` Their recovery could be months and months and maybe not even to full recovery , '' she said .\nMany of the injured said they were sitting toward the rear of the aircraft , Knudson said .\nBut 123 of the 307 people on board walked away uninjured .

He has about 10,000 hours as a pilot, Asiana said.\n\nHersman, who has discouraged speculation about whether the crew bore responsibility for the crash, downplayed the significance of the pilot's experience in her New Day interview.\n\n\"It's not unusual for crew to change aircraft types,\" she said. And with air crews flying all around the world, it's not unusual for pilots to fly into unfamiliar airports for the first time either.\n\nShe said it's important for the two pilots in charge of the aircraft during the \"very risky\" landing phase to work closely together, and while she said investigators have no evidence of cockpit communications problems, it's something investigators will be looking at.\n\nMary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said video and other data related to the crash suggest the crew \"lost situational awareness\" while approaching the airport.\n\n\"They're low and slow, and that's a problem,\" Schiavo said.\n\nAll four pilots have been interviewed by NTSB and South Korean investigators, said Choi Jeong-ho, the head of South Korea's Aviation Policy Bureau.\n\n\"We cannot reveal what's been said as it is an ongoing investigation,\" Choi said.\n\nThe pilots represented two teams -- a crew and a relief crew, said Hersman.\n\n\"I think it really is too early to conclude pilot error, because there is so much that we don't know,\" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.\n\nThe cockpit voice recorder -- which has been flown to Washington for analysis -- contains conversations between the pilots that were carried out in a combination of English and Korean, she said.\n\nHersman said that in most airplane crashes, investigators rarely find a single explanation for what went wrong.\n\n\"In most of our investigations, we find that it's not just one thing, it really is a combination of factors that lead to an accident,\" she said.\n\nWhile weather has been ruled out as a factor, other factors officials are investigating include whether construction at the airport may have played a role, Hersman said Sunday.\n\nWork to extend a runway safety area required the temporary shutdown of a system designed to help pilots land planes safely, she said.\n\nClues from voice recorder\n\nThe pilots apparently tried to speed up seven seconds before the crash, cockpit voice and flight data recorders showed.\n\nA stall warning sounded three seconds later, telling the pilots the plane was about to lose its ability to stay in the air.\n\nThen -- just 1.5 seconds before the plane slammed into the runway -- the crew decided to call off the landing and try to pull up for another try, Hersman said.\n\nIt was too late.\n\nThe frightening crash\n\nWith no warning from the cockpit, survivors said, the plane's rear struck the sea wall at the end of the runway. The impact severed the plane's tail and sent the rest of the body spinning on its belly.\n\nIn addition to the two deaths, 182 people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from severe scrapes to paralysis.\n\n\"We're lucky there hasn't been a greater loss of life,\" San Francisco Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White said.\n\nSome injured passengers remained hospitalized Monday, including six in critical condition at San Francisco General Hospital, said Dr. Margaret Knudson, the hospital's chief of surgery.\n\nAbout half of those admitted to the hospital had spinal fractures, she said. Others have head trauma.\n\n\"Their recovery could be months and months and maybe not even to full recovery,\" she said.\n\nMany of the injured said they were sitting toward the rear of the aircraft, Knudson said.\n\nBut 123 of the 307 people on board walked away uninjured. Benjamin Levy was among them.\n\n\"Honestly, I was waiting for the plane to ... start flipping upside down, in which case I think a lot of people would have not made it,\" Levy said.\n\n\"If we flipped, none of us would be here to talk about it,\" he said.",
