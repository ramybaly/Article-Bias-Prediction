As Donald Trump \u2019 s presidency stretches into its second year , democratic socialism has become a significant force in Democratic politics . Its rise comes as Democrats debate whether moving too far left will turn off voters .\n\u201c I stand with the democratic socialists , and I have decided to become a dues-paying member , \u201d Ringelstein told AP . \u201c It \u2019 s time to do what \u2019 s right , even if it \u2019 s not easy . \u201d\nThere are 42 people running for offices at the federal , state and local levels this year with the formal endorsement of the Democratic Socialists of America , the organization says . They span 20 states , including Florida , Hawaii , Kansas and Michigan .\nThe most ambitious Democrats in Washington have been reluctant to embrace the label , even as they embrace the policies defining modern-day democratic socialism : Medicare for all , a $ 15 minimum wage , free college tuition and the abolition of the federal department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement , also known as ICE .\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , Congress \u2019 only self-identified democratic socialist , campaigned Friday with the movement \u2019 s newest star , New York City congressional candidate Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez , a 28-year-old former bartender who defeated one of the most powerful House Democrats last month .\nHer victory fed a flame that was already beginning to burn brighter .

While Ringelstein and other DSA-backed candidates promote a \u201c big-tent \u201d philosophy , the group \u2019 s constitution describes its members as socialists who \u201c reject an economic order based on private profit \u201d and \u201c share a vision of a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production , economic planning , equitable distribution , feminism , racial equality and non-oppressive relationships . \u201d\nMembers during public meetings often refer to each other \u201c comrades , \u201d wear clothing featuring socialist symbols like the rose and promote authors such as Karl Marx .\nThe common association with the failed Soviet Union has made it difficult for sympathetic liberals to explain their connection .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t like the term socialist , because people do associate that with bad things in history , \u201d said Kansas congressional candidate James Thompson , who is endorsed by the DSA and campaigned alongside Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez , but is not a dues-paying democratic socialist . \u201c There \u2019 s definitely a lot of their policies that closely align with mine . \u201d\nThompson , an Army veteran turned civil rights attorney , is running again after narrowly losing a special election last year to fill the seat vacated by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo .
