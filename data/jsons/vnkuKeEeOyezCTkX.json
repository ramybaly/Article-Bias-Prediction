''\nPresident Barack Obama tried to quash that public sentiment this week by inviting to the White House a group of U.S. health workers who worked in African Ebola zones .\n`` We do n't react to our fears , but instead , we respond with common sense and skill and courage . That 's the best of our history -- not fear , not hysteria , not misinformation , '' Obama said .\nBut in a move that seemed to contradict the White House , the Pentagon this week put 30 U.S. soldiers in quarantine -- or `` controlled monitoring '' -- in Italy after they were stationed in Ebola-stricken West Africa .\nAt stake in the quarantine debate is the fight against Ebola itself , advocates say . Specifically , it 's the ability of health care workers who fight Ebola at its source to return immediately to their private and professional lives .\nA 21-day quarantine would discourage this rare pool of labor from taking on such hazardous duty in Africa , advocates say . If there are fewer doctors and nurses on the Ebola front , there 's a likelihood that the epidemic in West Africa could spread , experts say .\nThe rights of these health workers once they return home is governed by U.S. guidelines and health laws that ultimately favor states over the federal government .\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now requires greater symptom monitoring of doctors and nurses returning from West Africa , but stops short of requiring any type of quarantine , according to new rules implemented this week .\nStates have the power to exceed those CDC guidelines , and some do .\n`` We have a federal system in this country in which states are given significant authority for governing their constituents . That is certainly true when it comes to public safety and public health , '' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said this week . `` What we believe is important -- and I think this is a view that is shared by governors and local officials across the country -- is that these kinds of policies should be driven by science and the best scientific advice that is available . ''\nThe humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders , for which Hickox worked while in West Africa , condemned `` blanket forced quarantine for health care workers returning from Ebola affected countries , '' the organization said this week .\n`` Such a measure is not based upon established medical science , '' the group said .\nThe group supports `` scientifically grounded monitoring '' for homeward-bound aid workers , which `` is in accordance with the recommendations of public health experts . ''\nThe virus is spread through the direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infectious person -- that is , someone who shows symptoms of the virus -- and with surfaces and materials contaminated with those fluids . People remain infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus , and men can still transmit the virus through breast milk and semen for up to seven weeks after they recover from the disease , the World Health Organization says .\nTo demonstrate how the Hickox case can divide even the most sympathetic supporters , the freelance NBC cameraman who was a former Ebola patient endorsed Hickox 's declarations that she has a human and constitutional right to exit her home and roam the outdoors .\nBut would Ashoka Mukpo make that choice himself in the aftermath of his recovery from Ebola ?\nEven though the cameraman is now free of the virus , he recently chose not to visit a Halloween gathering because he did n't want to provoke public anxiety at a jack-o'-lantern exhibition attended by more 8,000 people .\n`` You know , I just worry about making people uncomfortable . I think I need a couple of weeks out of the hospital where I really can say , look , I 've been fine for three weeks , '' Mukpo told CNN .\nMukpo 's concern has a precedent : When NBC chief medical editor Dr. Nancy Snyderman violated a precautionary 21-day quarantine to reportedly obtain takeout food , she provoked public outrage .\n`` It is quite obvious that Snyderman is an arrogant and egotistical woman who has no concern/regard for anyone but herself , '' one man wrote .\n`` I hope this does n't just 'blow over ' in a month and NBC does n't allow you to return to your position as chief medical correspondent , '' one woman wrote .\nSnyderman later apologized for how members of her team , which had visited Ebola-infected Liberia , `` violated '' quarantine guidelines .\nMary Mayhew , Maine 's health commissioner , has said the process to seek a court order imposing a quarantine on Hickox has already begun .\nIt 's not entirely clear which side would win that court battle , partly because Ebola is regarded as a menace with no established cure and partly because there 's no evidence that Hickox has the disease , let alone a symptom suggesting it , experts say .\nUnder the U.S. Constitution , states have the authority over public health issues , except at international airports and seaports , where the federal government has jurisdiction , said attorney Steven Gravely , who wrote Virginia 's quarantine laws .\n`` We quarantine folks who have been exposed to a communicable disease , but who are not yet infected , '' Gravely said . `` The goal is to try to keep people who have been exposed , who may or may not be sick , from infecting other people . And so there 's a sound basis for quarantine medically , but there 's a lot of debate about whether -- what New York and New Jersey did was really appropriate . ''\nHickox 's attorneys contend there is no medical evidence that Hickox has any sign of Ebola .\nRather , Maine 's effort to seek a mandatory quarantine is based on politics , not science , said one of Hickox 's attorneys , Normal Siegel .\n`` This should not be directed and led by the politicians . It should be led by the medical community , '' Siegel said . `` The government ca n't take away your liberty unless there is a compelling basis for it . ''\nThe absence of any illness in Hickox is among the more salient facets of the expected court case , said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said .\n`` Maine has a law , like all states have law , that say people with contagious diseases can be forced in quarantine , '' Toobin said . `` The legal question ... is whether her condition , in perfectly good health without symptoms , counts as something that is covered by the law . That is a hard legal question because judges usually defer to public health authorities about their sense of risk .\n`` But here every scientific expert says that people without symptoms are not contagious , '' Toobin added . `` I think this is going to be a very hard legal problem unless her lawyers and the state of Maine can work out some sort of compromise .

The country launched a five-year study to unravel the mystery of the long-term health effects that plague survivors of the viral disease. Since the epidemic started more than a year ago in a remote village in Guinea, more than 11,000 people have died, the vast majority in three West African nations, according to the latest numbers from the World Health Organization . And that number is believed to be low, since there was widespread under-reporting of cases, according to WHO.

I think I need a couple of weeks out of the hospital where I really can say, look, I've been fine for three weeks,\" Mukpo told CNN.\n\nMukpo's concern has a precedent: When NBC chief medical editor Dr. Nancy Snyderman violated a precautionary 21-day quarantine to reportedly obtain takeout food, she provoked public outrage.\n\nThat anger was expressed on Snyderman's Facebook page.\n\n\"It is quite obvious that Snyderman is an arrogant and egotistical woman who has no concern/regard for anyone but herself,\" one man wrote.\n\n\"I hope this doesn't just 'blow over' in a month and NBC doesn't allow you to return to your position as chief medical correspondent,\" one woman wrote.\n\nDr. Nancy Snyderman appears on NBC News' 'Today' show.\n\nSnyderman later apologized for how members of her team, which had visited Ebola-infected Liberia, \"violated\" quarantine guidelines.\n\nCourt challenge\n\nMary Mayhew, Maine's health commissioner, has said the process to seek a court order imposing a quarantine on Hickox has already begun.\n\nIt's not entirely clear which side would win that court battle, partly because Ebola is regarded as a menace with no established cure and partly because there's no evidence that Hickox has the disease, let alone a symptom suggesting it, experts say.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, states have the authority over public health issues, except at international airports and seaports, where the federal government has jurisdiction, said attorney Steven Gravely, who wrote Virginia's quarantine laws.\n\n\"We quarantine folks who have been exposed to a communicable disease, but who are not yet infected,\" Gravely said. \"The goal is to try to keep people who have been exposed, who may or may not be sick, from infecting other people. And so there's a sound basis for quarantine medically, but there's a lot of debate about whether -- what New York and New Jersey did was really appropriate.\"\n\nScience vs. politics\n\nHickox's attorneys contend there is no medical evidence that Hickox has any sign of Ebola.\n\nShe's therefore no threat to society, her attorneys say.\n\nRather, Maine's effort to seek a mandatory quarantine is based on politics, not science, said one of Hickox's attorneys, Normal Siegel.\n\n\"This should not be directed and led by the politicians. It should be led by the medical community,\" Siegel said. \"The government can't take away your liberty unless there is a compelling basis for it.\"\n\nPhotos: Ebola fears hit Africa's safari industry hard Photos: Ebola fears hit Africa's safari industry hard Safari tourism suffering in Africa \u2013 A leopard in Botswana's Mashatu Game Reserve.

Hide Caption 7 of 7\n\nThe absence of any illness in Hickox is among the more salient facets of the expected court case, said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said.\n\n\"Maine has a law, like all states have law, that say people with contagious diseases can be forced in quarantine,\" Toobin said. \"The legal question... is whether her condition, in perfectly good health without symptoms, counts as something that is covered by the law. That is a hard legal question because judges usually defer to public health authorities about their sense of risk.\n\n\"But here every scientific expert says that people without symptoms are not contagious,\" Toobin added. \"I think this is going to be a very hard legal problem unless her lawyers and the state of Maine can work out some sort of compromise.\"",
