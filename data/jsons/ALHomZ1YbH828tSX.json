As of Friday , what is being called `` coronavirus '' ( this is actually a name for a family of viruses including the common cold ; medical experts are calling the actual virus in question COVID-19 ) had supposedly infected 75,567 people in China and killed 2,239 of them . Outside China , another 1,152 cases had been reported in 26 other countries , causing eight deaths , including recent outbreaks in South Korea and Iran .
