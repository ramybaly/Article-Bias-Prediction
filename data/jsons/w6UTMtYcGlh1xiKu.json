Mary Landrieu soldiered through her re-election race this year with sinking poll numbers and the heavy drag of President Barack Obama , the refrain from her strategists and supporters was always the same : Do n't count her out . She 's a fighter . She will pull it off in the end .\nBut in the hours before a runoff election on Saturday , when the three-term Louisiana Democrat faces Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy , it is hard to find anyone predicting the kind of eleventh hour victory that Landrieu pulled off in 1996 and 2002 -- turning her into a political legend .\n`` Sen. Landrieu has been a fabulous closer , '' said Joshua Stockley , a political science professor at the University of Louisiana at Monroe . `` Two of her three races , she was not supposed to win . ''\nLandrieu is facing voters more than a month after the midterm elections that virtually wiped out Democrats in the South .

As the mayor of New Orleans in the 1970s , Moon Landrieu won the respect of many black voters by desegregating the workforce and opening high-ranking city jobs and contracts to blacks .\nBut the collapse of the coalition that always carried Landrieu across the finish line was stunning on Nov. 4 . Turnout was strong among black voters , who comprise about 30 % of the electorate . But Landrieu 's support among white voters slid to 18 % from 33 % in 2008 .
