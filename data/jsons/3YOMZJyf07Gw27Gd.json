Now , more than a million voters are on the books . There are nearly 700,000 voters in Clark County alone .\nAt the same time the state 's population was exploding , Nevada 's Mormon population slipped from 12 % in 1986 to an estimated 7 % today .\nAlthough Mitt Romney is certain to energize Mormon voters this election season as the first member of his church to helm a major party 's presidential ticket , political watchers here say the LDS vote in Nevada rarely lives up to its billing in the national media .\nJUST WATCHED Michele Bachmann on being VP Replay More Videos ...
